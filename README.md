Our system is a simple, web-based photo management platform for KD Studio that allows an admin to securely log in, upload photos with captions, and delete photos from the gallery.
It runs locally using XAMPP and is built with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The gallery is dynamically updated from the database, so any changes made by the admin are reflected instantly on the website.
The system includes basic security features such as input validation and file type restrictions to ensure safe image uploads.
While designed for local use, it provides a solid foundation for future expansion, such as online deployment, role-based access control, and enhanced user interaction.
